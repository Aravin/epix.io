            The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed,
            collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be
            used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object
            management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of
            HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
            independently of the data being transferred.
